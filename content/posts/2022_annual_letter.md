Dear friends and family,


When 2022 started, I didn't know what to do with my life. I was lost. But you can't connect the dots looking forward; they only make sense when you look backward. We faced challenges at every turn and accomplished many great things together. We shared many meaningful experiences, tested our limits, and broke down our mental barriers. All these dots ended up connecting, and everything made sense in the end.

Together, we became programmers and entrepreneurs. We won two hackathons and built more than ten software projects. When the year started, I was still in business school and didn't know how to code. We assembled a team for a hackathon and learned all the necessary to create a project in 24 hours. It was a difficult task, but we made something remarkable. I became addicted to the process of programming and building. Soon afterward, we made a dozen software projects and designs for clients and companies. This included our first startup. Though the project didn't become what we had hoped, we and others saw the potential in ourselves. Samuel, JC, and many others kindly offered their support and mentorship, which are invaluable.

It was an adventurous year. We traveled across North America. We visited Seattle, Hawaii, Vancouver, and Whistler on the west coast. We experienced New York City, Mont-Tremblant, Quebec City, and Miami on the east coast. The culture in each city was distinct and meaningful on its own. The views were marvelous. Each trip taught me something new about how people lived around the world. How can you say you want to change the world if you haven't even seen the world? I've made it a goal of mine to travel through as many countries as possible in the coming years.

Having the right environment is the most important. As an old saying goes, you are the average of your five closest friends. People like Tommy, Anton, Elliot, and Elian especially pushed me to pursue what's challenging but meaningful. We conquered our fears by staring into the abyss. We skydived from 13,000ft, ran a half-marathon, and took difficult classes to challenge ourselves. We went through meaningful romantic relationships and breakups. We supported each other in the most challenging times. We created communities to break down our comfort zone, and we learned from each success and failure.

We must continue working on things that matter. It doesn't have to be a non-profit charity. It's things that are more important than money. We should aim to make gifts for the world: make good art, write good software, and build good products for ourselves and our friends. Do not be intimidated by the difficulty of the problems. So often, we set barriers for ourselves: "I can't do it! I can't solve this!" Our thoughts become our beliefs, our beliefs become our actions, and our actions become a reality. It doesn't matter what our mind tells us. We must ask, "what if?" What if I can?" What you think determines your situation. Thinking negatively has all the downsides, with none of the positive sides. Courage isn't the absence of fear; courage is the mastery of fear. To think that the problem is trivial, we have already solved half of the problem. Qui ose gagne.

I will keep building a culture for truth seekers, first principle thinkers, contrarian thinkers, futuristic innovators, and hard-working people. We must seek the truth behind ideas and ourselves to make great things. Knowing our intention is half of the battle. We must not be trapped by the results of other people's thinking, and we must have the courage to follow our hearts and intuition. Do not seek money or status. Do not become mimetic. Do not think pessimistically. Never stop questioning. Play long-term games with long-term people. Learn, build, and share. And like what Steve Jobs said: Stay hungry, stay foolish.

What's the most ambitious plan I could come up with? What would I propose if I had unlimited resources? There are many problems in the world today: stable totalitarianism, climate change, healthcare crisis, world hunger, and wars. I believe in solving problems face-to-face rather than by proxy, and we could solve these problems through technological innovation. Innovation in energy, automation, and education are the key factors that will drive future growth. I imagine a world without hunger and every man free from physical, mental, and spiritual shackles. I am determined to accelerate the world's transition to complete automation that empowers humankind.

What will I achieve in 2023? I will continue practicing what Carl taught me: Focus, consistency, and patience. I'm aiming for absolute competence, directing all of my behaviors to be competent in one single area and get mastery over it. I will work on becoming skilled in mathematics, programming, community/company building, power-lifting, and writing. It's time I take action to make tangible differences in my life consistently. I'm not saying that I won't have fun. I will seek out adventures and discomfort more than ever and keep an open mind to new experiences in different cultures.

Above all, we must work together to contribute to our community and society. We are Canadians. This country has given us remarkable freedom, opportunities, and security. When I first received my Canadian citizenship in October, my whole family cried from happiness – I was finally free, and Canada offered me the ability to pursue my dreams and achieve my goals. As educated researchers and entrepreneurs, we are this country's best. In an increasingly totalitarian and chaotic world, we must contribute to the defense of the Canadian democratic government and the empowerment of all Canadians. It's time for us to give back to our local community intelligently and generously.

I thank all of you again for this incredible year. I learned a lot from each one of you. In 2023, we will build world-changing projects, dominate our fields, and go on grand adventures. Together, we will walk further than we can ever walk alone.

I look forward to the new year with all of you. We will win together.


With the warmest regards,
