### 2 ideas I learnt this week
**I. Learning in public** 

The process of creating is the best way of learning. [1] We learn to create. Why not create while learning? 

Feynman was known as one of the greatest teachers. He was able to breakdown difficult concept into simple explanations. Writing is a way of teaching.

Inspired by Jame Clear’s *3-2-1 Thursday*, I plan to share my learning weekly.

**II. Fail fast, fail often**

Fail fast is an important principle for experimenting, learning, and optimizing for solutions. It’s okay to fail, the more we fail the more we learn. 


### 2 original ideas
**I. Agile development for everyday life**

Create a group of people and set individual goals. Then, everyday we will have a meeting talk about our progress on the goals. And at the end of each sprint, we will share our learning and faults with each other.

**II. Mathematicians and Entrepreneurs**

There are a lot of similarities between mathematicians and entrepreneurs. Both groups of people are extrememly passionate about the problems they are to solving. They are focused, hard working, and simply inspiring.
