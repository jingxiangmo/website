## Inspiration

Agile development is a common framework in large software development companies. Its main philosophy is to provide continuous improvements and natural mechanism for small teams to respond to changes quickly.

Itâ€™s an effective and working model. Teams are able to set realistic sprints and have daily standup meetings to keep each other on track.

Having goals is not enough. A good support system will foster long term progress while providing continuous improvements. \[1]

In this proposal, I would like to include the main principles of agile development rather than the all the key agile concepts.

## Methodology

To begin, I would like to define a few terms:

A *Sprint* is about 1 to 4 weeks to complete a set amount of goals. The benefit is to break down complex projects into actionable steps.

A *Team* is a small group of 3-7 people working towards a similar area but might not the same individual paths.

Daily *StandUps* are about 10 to 15 minutes for the team to check on each other and to remove blockers that members might be facing. \[2]

**Sprint Review** is a meeting where the team will have an opportunity to discuss their learnings from the last sprint and help other find areas of improvements for the next sprint.

The main idea is simple: 

> Every week, the team will set **sprint** plans that will be held accountable by **daily stand ups** and will share their learning at the **sprint retrospective** meetings.

## Implementation

1. A discord group will be made for the **team**.
2. Notion pages will be created to track daily stands ups and sprint plans.
3. A fixed time for daily standup will be set. 
4. Weekly review meetings will be held on a chosen day after each sprint.
